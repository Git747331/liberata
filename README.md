# Getting Started

Welcome to the repository for Liberata's informational site!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the website locally

Once you navigate to the project directory with:

### `cd liberata`

execute:

### `npm start`

to run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploying and monitoring changes to GitHub Pages

New merges to the repository will automatically trigger a deployment job. If you need to force an update after getting code approved, you can also run:

In the Actions tab of this repository, you can view the status and history of all deployment jobs that have been run on the site. If updates aren't being shown on the page as expected, you can check this tab for build errors.

## Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
